        Implicitly Connected Quadrilateral (ICQ) format, with Q = 128 (the

        labeled as though they were grid points on the faces of a cube so that
        each of the six faces (F) contains (Q+1)^2 vertices and Q^2 facets.   
        For a complete description of the ICQ format and the ordering of the  
        vertices in the file, see the data set catalog file in the catalog    
        directory, and the document ICQMODEL.ASC in the document directory.
